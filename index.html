<h1>Idleness in Observation</h1>
<p>
There are many types of games - some involving target practice, some involving extraordinary leaps of athletic ability and some involving taking care of simulated automatons. In the definition of what a “Game” is, Wikipedia states that the “Key components of games are goals, rules, challenge, and interaction”.</p>

<p>
Now let’s break this down into smaller components if we are to take this definition of attributes as sufficient for describing what a game is:</p>

<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>
A goal is easy to achieve if the player is able to determine a limit. By negotiating the goal limit with ourselves, we can determine whether the goal was achieved or not. More optimistic personalities tend to aim for negotiations that are more flexible while pessimistic personalities tend to create more barriers of difficulty before considering a goal ‘acceptable’ and ‘complete’.</p>

<p>
The goal is a negotiation you choose in order to fulfill your narrative of being involved in the process and also assessing the completeness of the process.</p>

<h2>Rule</h2>

<p>
When any process has rules, it has a system. It has a pattern for which parts all connect to each other and it is the blackbox for which the player discovers over repeated attempts at mapping the entire system from sensory inputs. Repeated attempts at mapping is learning about systems in our experiential environment as a whole.</p>

<p>
Unlike goals, rules are not negotiable - especially in games. There are hard and soft rules, and they can deduct and or reset your scoring or status for that slice of perceived time. Being negatively affected by violating rules is what causes our fear and anxiety to rise, which can trigger the necessary chemicals to recreate a sense of urgency, excitement or stress. Note that all these feelings we set up are generally intentional performances to play a role of the player and not accidental. A person playing a first person shooting game knows they are playing that system of rules and expect the kinds of adrenaline they may receive as a result of the game’s structure and format.</p>

<p>
Rules provide a set of boundaries for which the player understands their emotional and mental involvement and participation level. When the game is too stressful/anxious players tend to prefer other games that are more relaxed. On the other hand, some relaxed games drive players to more pressure-based play.</p>

<h2>Challenge</h2>

<p>
What do we mean by challenge? What measurement in terms of a maxima or a minima do we consider a challenge valid for one player versus another? For some who have practiced a particular skill in one game, a challenge is considerably more difficult than for the casual player. Their perceptions of present challenge start at different points simultaneously. In this sense, we can say that a challenge is subjective for the player, depending on their familiarity with the game’s system, but the rules formalize their leveling both at the broader player skill level (a leaderboard as an example).</p>

<p>
Now if we think of a game such as one involving luck and/or chance, we assume a random system that the player may develop rituals around validating certain patterns within the chaos to compensate for the challenge aspect. Randomness of a system encourages a player to find patterns.</p>

<p>
Conversely, if we think of a system as one involving skill of a particular action (such as targeting/shooting) or familiarity with a pattern (puzzles), the player may developer rituals around validating more detailed sub-rule components, branching from the core skill/familiarity.</p>

<p>
In both cases, players are doing the same thing - finding rituals and patterns and confirmation counterbalanced by adjustments in order to complete a challenge.</p>

<h2>Interaction</h2>

<p>
Any sensory input with a game can be considered interaction - where you have more than one system affecting another system. In this context, a single-player game is a player (who is a system) interacting with parts of the game (game systems).</p>

<h2>Creating Idleness</h2>

<p>
How can you create a game out of doing nothing and also fulfilling the requirements above?</p>

<p>
For the goal, the player negotiates whether or not the game provides motivation in the perception of a goal or continual goals. The goal can be an end story or a never-ending story. For an idle game, it’s the illusion of “more (earned) opportunity over the hill as time passes” that enables the passive participation. In this way of thinking of the game’s dynamic, it makes sense to set it as a never-ending story. An infinite machine.</p>

<h2>An Infinite Machine of Time Experienced</h2>

<p>
Observing gradual change over time lived can be one of the key passive pleasures of being a living creature in this environment we all live in. Learning to understand the pattern of gradual change over time is something one can sense despite not being able to describe clearly. The rules of how parameters change over time are to be figured out by the player over time experienced.</p>

<p>
In this structure, the goal becomes a personal acknowledgement of the cumulative ebb and flow of gradual change over time. The challenge of personal commitment to the time passed and the accumulation of game values signify an acknowledgement of life experienced and time appreciated.</p>

<p>
Interaction in idle games is voluntary - there are no expectations for you to compete with others on your own lived journey - it’s a gentle reminder to interact if you choose to move forward or take a passive observational position, taking on multiple roles as a single player in a completely optional system where you make the goals.</p>
