<p>This is you. You are a person. Who likes things. Maybe music and fashion. Maybe certain genres of movies. Maybe types of foods. You think if you align all these together into a cohesive narrative, you will be able to broadcast your real identity to other people in order to find others who may share in your particular cohesion or a subset thereof.</p>

<p>Observation: you think you have a responsibility to uphold an identity for others to acknowledge</p>

<p>We like alignments and patterns and equilibrium. We thrive for balance in our interactive environment and our interactive bodies. But nobody tells us how to balance nor what patterns should be obvious. That is up to us to figure out during our entire lifecycle.</p>

<p>Observation: we like patterns and predictability so that we can explore the perimeters with confidence.</p>
<p>Observation: we enjoy high confidence and high self esteem.</p>

<p>When our identity is challenged in any way, we feel threatened. Feeling negative reactions means placing our mindset into a role of low confidence and low self esteem. If one is not confident of their odds in the final outcome of this challenge, they risk putting their own decisions out in the spotlight. That spotlight risk is a damage to the identity being performed and thus increases our fear of being wrong - and in the end, being rejected by others.</p>

<p>Observation: when our self esteem and/or confidence levels are low, any potential interaction or action that doesn't align with our current rules will feel like a threat or a violation of who we chose to roleplay as.</p>
<p>Observation: when our feelings about ourselves are at a lower threshold, we rely on external validation to keep ourselves at a higher threshold. Sometimes this works and sometimes it doesn't.</p>

<p>The discomfort increases as we realize we sometimes are placed in situations where we have to question our current self esteem and confidence levels and why they are affected so much by the ephemeral rules of our identity. And that's the cycle of it all - the cycle of our life is made up of the ebb and flow of these two worlds - of wanting stable patterns of identity but also acknowledging their ephemerality in the greater story of our lives - especially if we choose to let go of who we think we are.</p>

<p>Observation: we struggle between wanting consistency as a structure for our identity and being confronted with external factors that make us question this commitment.</p>

<p>Control is a process of wanting to maintain predictability to hold onto knowledge and maintain consistency. On the other hand, entropy is where this consistency eventually flows into and is unavoidable. Losing control or sensing lack of control is wanting to hold onto consistency when it is not yours to hold onto. It was never in your control, you are always in a moving state of temporal informational interactions and you move in a direction that nothing else stays in the direction of for very long.</p>
