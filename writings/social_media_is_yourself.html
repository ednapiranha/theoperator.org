There was a period of time in my programming career that revolved around a collection of repeating elements and/or themes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Anonymity</li>
  <li>Small communities/networks</li>
  <li>Visual and user simplicity</li>
</ul>

<p>When some of these projects gained more attention in the public, they changed dynamics and the experience shifted, swayed with the motions of information being broadcasted and absorbed in a seemingly endless cycle of pull and push.</p>

<p>All the attractions of the more popular chat applications contained the need for validation and the need for time commitment by shared participants. A shared experience, commitment proven through real-time updating and the ideal visual indicators give us an opportunity to speak what is on our mind - in layers.</p>

<p>The first layer is the shield - the layer that accepts full rejection and is skeptical of full acceptance by the tribe. Once a ritual is inserted into their internal cycles through tribal rituals, they will change their skepticism into more of a bias towards full acceptance. As a result, the need for validation pulls the person more towards commitment and contribution towards the tribal rituals in order to gain more authority and thus, more validation.</p>

<p>This entire process is a conversation to one's own mind - and everyone is doing it. We enter the arena of a subsystem as a new player in a new game. We are first cautious, but we learn the game's rules one by one. As we learn to figure out the rules, we can gain enough authority to negotiate changing the rules. When two sides disagree on the state of rule changes, we result in disagreements that can range from minor to extreme.</p>

<p>We have these disagreements because we think it involves some external reason with a clear label - a categorization of parameters to contain a concept. The real reason is a lot more distant from that initial assumption - we have disagreements about the rules in the games that we're in because the rules conflict with our internal system's ideas of the rules and how they should be. If we cannot resolve this "fact", we disagree.</p>

<p>We also have these disagreements because someone changes or hides information about the rules without their knowledge. That is considered "cheating" and some may find it to be their life's duty to enforce fairness and equilibrium as they see fit.</p>

<p>All the above happens in all social media as it goes from birth to maturity.</p>

<p>When we express online, we are looking for someone else to also agree with our thoughts. And they are also looking for the same in response. So that means we are transacting this virtual bartering of thought agreement to constantly reconfirm our internal rules. We are constantly looking for rule affirmation through others. The ones who need it the most have the lower self confidence and self esteem, needing others to supplant their fix until they need it again.</p>

<p>The question we should ask is why we repeat that cycle? Why do we progress through this method? Is there an efficiency to this process? Sometimes change is made on a greater scale through systems in social media involving similar flows.</p>
