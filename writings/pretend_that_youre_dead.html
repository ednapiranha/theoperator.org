<p>We feel that we are alive, but we are dying constantly. Cells are replaced regularly and sometimes cells overproduce creating mutations that destroy us over time.</p>

<p>What we live in is a loop - a cyclical revisitation of our habits and patterns and stories that we formulate in our mind and body. None of this is the reality you might think it is.</p>

<p>We spend the majority of our life in a state of trying to rebalance who we are against the world we live within, and yet this rebalancing act seems unrestricted and chaotic. There are no rules about how to live in a state of equilibrium with that which is part of you and connected to you. Do you think your thought processes and actions are intentionally meaningful? To whom and when and why? How much of you is made up of a role playing mirror with other roles from other players that you picked up over a lifetime's worth of information?</p>

<p>Who are our selves? Who are we? We are not individuals. We are not necessarily 'one' shared individual in the traditional way we would understand an individual. We are trillions of systems interconnecting to create the sensation of being alive and feeling a sense of self and the opportunity to explore identity.</p>

<p>Death is not the end of self. It is the end of the illusion of self.</p>
